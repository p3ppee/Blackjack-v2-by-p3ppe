First version,

It's called V2 beacause i made the first verion a while ago, when i just started coding

i haven't used any functions (def) because when i started v2 i didn't even know they existed lol 
(now i know but its a nice way to challenge myself)

problems: ace value is always 11 , ask tons of time if you want to draw cards, random Error sometimes.



Second verion (V2.1)

Fix: random Error, it asks if u want to draw only when you need to

problems: ace valure is always 11

new features: money sistem, save money, win/loss counter, better ascii art
